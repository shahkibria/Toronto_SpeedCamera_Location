# Toronto_SpeedCamera_Location
Presenting Speed Camera Locations for new 50 Speed Cameras added by the City on May 25. 

The city of Toronto added 50 new speed camera locations on early May 2021 but their locations aren't uploaded on the City of Toronto page. This map is a presentation of approximate locations of these speed cameras. I used excel to extract the locations from a news webpage, then used Google Maps to get approximate coordinates. Finally used Python to turn my CSV file into a dictionary and extracted the data into a .js file. 

NOTE: If the speed cameras are changed, the map will not be updated. Also the locations are approximate coordinates. The coordinates were not taken from any official source and I am not responsible if they are not absolutely correct.
